Changes from version to version:

[ 1.6 -> 1.7 ]
Fixed some bugs due to the renaming. Added backwards compatibility glue
(specifically, MAKE_GENERIC-HASHTABLE now calls MAKE-GENERIC-HASH-TABLE
and REGISTER-HASH-FUNCTION now calls REGISTER-TEST-DESIGNATOR)

[ 1.3 -> 1.6 ]
Many, small, changes. Two large (name-changes in the API). All spurred
by submitting GENHASH as a Common Lisp Document Repository document.

[ 1.2 -> 1.3 ]
Added some bug fixes that made the benchmarking work not-too-well with 
Lispworks.

[ 1.x -> 1.5 ]

Made re-ergistering a hash tuple slightly less fragile (as long as test
function and hash function are EQL, no error is thrown).
